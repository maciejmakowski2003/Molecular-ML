# Machine Learning on Molecules and Molecular Fingerprints

"Machine Learning on Molecules and Molecular Fingerprints" workshops, ML in PL 2024 conference

Presentation slides are available [here](https://github.com/j-adamczyk/molecular_ml_workshops/blob/master/lecture_slides.pdf).

Jupyter Notebooks with exercises:
1. [RDKit intro](https://github.com/j-adamczyk/molecular_ml_workshops/blob/master/01_rdkit_intro.ipynb)
2. [Molecular property prediction](https://github.com/j-adamczyk/molecular_ml_workshops/blob/master/02_molecular_property_prediction.ipynb)
3. [Virtual screening](https://github.com/j-adamczyk/molecular_ml_workshops/blob/master/03_virtual_screening.ipynb)

For solutions to the exercises, see the "_solution.ipynb" files, i.e.:
1. [RDKit intro solution](https://github.com/j-adamczyk/molecular_ml_workshops/blob/master/01_rdkit_intro_solution.ipynb)
2. [Molecular property prediction solution](https://github.com/j-adamczyk/molecular_ml_workshops/blob/master/02_molecular_property_prediction_solution.ipynb)
3. [Virtual screening solution](https://github.com/j-adamczyk/molecular_ml_workshops/blob/master/03_virtual_screening_solution.ipynb)

For self-paced learning, recommended order is doing parts in sequence. For each part, start with lecture slides for that part, do exercises, and compare with solutions.
